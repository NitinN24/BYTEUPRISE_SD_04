Solver Algorithm: Utilizes a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find the solution to the Sudoku puzzle.
Output: Displays the solved Sudoku puzzle on the console, or indicates if no solution exists.
How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the SudokuSolver.java file using a Java compiler.
Run the compiled Java program.
