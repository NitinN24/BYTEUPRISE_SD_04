# Task :- 04 
# Develop Sudoku Solver

## Description:
This Java program solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Features:
Input: Accepts a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as input from the user via the command line. Empty cells are represented by the number 0.
Solver Algorithm: Utilizes a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find the solution to the Sudoku puzzle.
Output: Displays the solved Sudoku puzzle on the console, or indicates if no solution exists.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the SudokuSolver.java file using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled Java program.
4. Input the Sudoku puzzle row by row when prompted, using 0 to represent empty cells.
5. The program will solve the puzzle and display the solution on the console.
